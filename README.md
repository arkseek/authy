# Arktos, the all in one bot.
Arktos is a open source bot for everyone to use! Developed by arkseek. 
# Packages
- CommandKit which has a Event handler and a Command handler (+ more!) built into it which makes the code easier to read and understand (https://commandkit.js.org)
- Discord.js v14
# Goal
This project is mainly made by me for me to learn web development and how to work with API's a bit!! I am a total beginner and I hope i am learning this correctly. 
# Guide
to get started, head over to the index.js file in the main directory and go to the last line, change the ***"place_your_token_here"*** with your discord bot token.
# Disclaimer
This bot is not finished in the slightest
